**[Factory method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)** is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of \
creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead \
of direct constructor call (`new` operator). Subclasses can override this method \
to change the class of objects that will be created.
