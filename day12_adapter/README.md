An **[adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)** wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. \
The wrapped object isnâ€™t even aware of the adapter. \
For example, you can wrap an object that operates in meters and kilometers with an adapter that converts all of the data to imperial units such as feet and miles.
