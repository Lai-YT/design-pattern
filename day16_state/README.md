The **[State pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state)** suggests that you create new classes for all possible states of an object and extract all state-specific behaviors into these classes.

Instead of implementing all behaviors on its own, the original object, called *context*, stores a reference to one of the state objects that represents its current state, and delegates all the state-related work to that object.
