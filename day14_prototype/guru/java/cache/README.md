# Prototype registry

You could implement a centralized prototype registry (or factory), which would contain a set of pre-defined prototype objects. \
This way you could retrieve new objects from the factory by passing its name or other parameters. \
The factory would search for an appropriate prototype, clone it and return you a copy.
