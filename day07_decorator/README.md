**[Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)** is a structural pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects \
dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects.

Using decorators you can wrap objects countless number of times since both target \
objects and decorators follow the same interface. The resulting object will get \
a stacking behavior of all wrappers.
