A **[facade](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)** is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. \
A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. \
However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.
